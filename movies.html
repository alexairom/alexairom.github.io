	<h1>Here are my favorite movies!</h1>
	
	<h2>The Longest Ride</h2>
		<p>The Longest Ride is a movie about a boy and a girl who fall in love after reading about a love story that took place in an earlier time period. The two love stories coincide to create a beautiful movie.
		<p>This movie is one of my favorites because I always love a good rom-com!
 
	<h2> John Tucker Must Die</h2>
		<p>This movie is one of my favorites because of the amazing cast it has! Each time I watch this movie, I am always laughing.
		<p>This movie is a great movie to watch with friends! It's about a boy who dates three women at the same time, and then each of the women finding out.<p>
