	<h1>Here are my favorite favorite actors/actresses!</h1>
	
	<h2>Nick Jonas</h2>
		<p>I love Nick Jonas because I've always loved the Camp Rock movies! I think his acting and singing in all of the movies are phenomenal!
		<p>Part of the reason why I love Nick Jonas as an actor is because I've always loved his music before he began acting!

	<h2> Miley Cyrus</h2>
		<p>I love Miley Cyrus as an actress because her acting in Hannah Montana and The Last Song was so well done! I love that show and I love that movie because she was a great character in both!		
		<p>Miley Cyrus has also starred in many other films such as So Undercover and LOL. Each movie and tv show that she stars in always ends up being one of my favorites!<p>
